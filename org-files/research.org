* Current Projects

** The effect of the deductible on health care expenditures

Together with Minke Remmerswaal we try to model how health care expenditures in the Netherlands vary with the level of the deductible. We use a Bayesian model for this, estimated with [[https://docs.pymc.io/][pymc3]] in python. Using python makes it easy to generate interactive graphs. As an illustration, the following graph shows one aspect of the fit of our current model. In particular, it plots the average (log) expenditures per age-gender category in the data (dots) together with the average sample outcomes from our model (line). The graph is generated with [[http://pyviz.org/][pyviz]] using the [[https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/][bokeh]] backend.

In April 2019 we gave a [[http://janboone.github.io/department/ENTER_2019/presentation.html][presentation]] of the paper at the [[http://www.enter-network.org/en/][ENTER Jamboree]].
